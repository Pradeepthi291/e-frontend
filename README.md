# ORU Phones Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for the ORU Phones e-commerce project.

## What I implemented

I built the user interface using Next.js and TypeScript. The frontend includes:

- A **Homepage** with multiple clickable cards and buttons  
- A **Best Deals** page with a left-side filter panel (interactable but non-functional) and a grid of product cards  
- A **Product Info** page showing detailed product information, images, and action buttons like Buy, Contact Seller, and Save  
- A common **Header** and **Footer** on each page with dummy links and buttons  
- Integration with the backend API to send user interaction data for behavior tracking  

## Deployment & Repo

- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Pradeepthi291/e-frontend

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install`

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Future improvements
